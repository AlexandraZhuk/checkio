My solutions for the missions on checkio.org

This list will be updated only when hitting some milestone and (probably) it isn't the latest version of my solutions.  
You can check my current progress on checkio: https://checkio.org/user/narimiran/

If you find any of the solutions useful or you have some suggestion/improvement, I would be glad to hear from you.
